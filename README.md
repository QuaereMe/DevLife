This is a repository for teaching general concepts related to the role of a software engineer.

Over the course of a few weeks, this repository will be used to cover basics for:
- software project management
- engineering tools (IDEs, Git, etc)
- coding conventions
- some design patterns in Java

... and more.

I've set it under the AGPLv3 because, in the interest of learning, this thing should be accessible to anyone.

More updates to come.
